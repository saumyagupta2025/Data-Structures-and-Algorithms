# Data Structures & Algorithm

Welcome to my Github repository containing solutions to the LeetCode and GFG problems I have solved during the #100DaysOfCode challenge! This repository contains solutions written in Java programming language. Each solution includes a problem description, and the code implementation. 

Feel free to use this repository as a resource for learning and practicing problem-solving skills in preparation for technical interviews or just for fun! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

Thank you for checking out my repository! Happy coding!
